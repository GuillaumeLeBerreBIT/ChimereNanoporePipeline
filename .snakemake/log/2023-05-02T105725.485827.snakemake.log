NameError: The name 'out_fastq' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:
python3 {script}/TrimmerLarge.py -f {out_fastq} -i PorechopABI/ -o {output} -m 'D' -r '.fasta'
